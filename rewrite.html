      <h2>Original context</h2>
      <p class="meta">The original README explained how to install and run a small server, with commands, environment variables, and debugging steps. It assumed prior knowledge of the terminal and package managers.</p>

      <h2>Non-technical rewrite (audience: community stakeholders)</h2>
      <p>Imagine an app that helps local volunteers organize events. We built a small program that runs on a computer or cloud service and keeps track of events, volunteers, and messages. You don't need to know how it was built to use it — here's what it does and how it helps:</p>

      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stores event details (time, place, tasks)</li>
        <li>Lets volunteers sign up and receive messages</li>
        <li>Makes it easy for organizers to see who is available</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why it matters</h3>
      <p>Instead of coordinating by scattered email and spreadsheets, the app centralizes information so volunteers save time and organizers can plan reliably. That means fewer missed tasks and more successful events.</p>

      <h3>How to get started (simple)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the site (or we can host it for you).</li>
        <li>Create an organizer account and add your event information.</li>
        <li>Invite volunteers by sharing a link — they can sign up with just a few clicks.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Need help?</h3>
      <p>If you'd like, I can host a demo and walk your team through the app in 15–20 minutes.</p>

      <h4>Notes on the rewrite process</h4>
      <p class="meta">In the rewrite I removed technical jargon (like "npm install" and "environment variables"), focused on user benefits and outcomes, and used steps with clear, non-technical actions. The goal was to reduce barriers for community members or stakeholders who need to understand the project's value without technical detail.</p>
