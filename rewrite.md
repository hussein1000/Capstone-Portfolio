# Rewritten Piece for a Non-Technical Audience

This piece is adapted from my [original technical document link] to make it understandable for a general audience.

---

## Original Context
The original document explained [topic], focusing on [technical detail].

## Rewritten Version
Imagine you’re explaining this concept to a non-technical friend. Here’s how I reframed it:

> Instead of focusing on the algorithms or codebase, I focused on the “why” and “how it helps.”  
> The goal was to make the reader see the value of the work without needing to understand the technical details.

**Reflection:**  
This exercise taught me to prioritize empathy and clarity, choosing plain language over jargon.
