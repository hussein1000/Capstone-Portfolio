# Welcome to My Technical Writing Portfolio

Hello! I'm [Hussein_Saleh], a [student / technical writer / engineer / communicator] with a passion for making complex ideas clear and accessible.  
This portfolio showcases selected works that reflect my growth in technical communication, clarity, and audience awareness.

## Mission Statement

I aim to create documentation and communication materials that empower readers to **understand, build, and innovate**.  
My writing focuses on precision, structure, and empathy for the reader â€” whether they are engineers or non-technical users.
